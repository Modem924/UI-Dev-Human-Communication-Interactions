> #### Why Elderask?
   - Problem: According to todays South Korea, most of the people wait in front of the pharmacies to buy the masks to avoid from Novel Corona virus.
   - Problem: There are some applications on cellphones that show the inventories of the masks of the users' vicinity drugstores, such as "DokDak" and "Mask Scanner". However, the problem is that the employees of the drugstores have no time to renew the stock status of their masks.
