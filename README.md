 #### Current Issues due to the Novel Corona Virus [written 2020.03.15]
   - Problem: According to todays South Korea, most of the people wait in front of the pharmacies to buy the masks to avoid from Novel Corona virus. 

   - Problem: There are some applications on cellphones that show the inventories of the masks of the users' vicinity drugstores, such as "DokDak" and "Mask Scanner". However, the problem is that the employees of the drugstores have no time to renew the stock status of their masks. 

   - Problem: It is quite okay for the young adults to wait in the lines. However, for those **elders who are older than 65 years old**, they have mentioned from the interview from YTN that they cannot even wait to buy masks since the masks are sold in 10 minutes because the young ages are waiting from the early morning.>
